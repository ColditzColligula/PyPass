# PyPass
A Python3 based Password Generator

*Work in Progress*

PyPass is a Password Generator utilizing cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators to create a Password of your desired length and complexity.

Run the script in your Console/Terminal, select your desired complexity (Uppercase, Lowercase, Digits, Symbols) and the length of your Password (min 4 - max 128) and click on "Generate Password".

A small field on the bottom will give you an estimate on how "secure" your Password will be.

For more information on how to create and choose a good password and how to maintain good password policy, check Security.org

You may also toggle the option "Copy Password to clipboard". It does exactly what it says. Just right-click and "Paste" or Ctrl-V your Password to where you need it.
